Feature Extraction:
    -> The mapping from textual data to real valued vectors is called feature extraction.
    ->  the process of converting raw text into numerical representations that machine learning algorithms can process

Common Techniques are:
1. BOW(Bag of Words): List of unique words in the text corpus
    It models text as an unordered collection of words, disregarding grammar, word order, and syntax while capturing the frequency of each word's occurrence.
    This approach treats a document as a "bag" where only the presence and count of words matter, not their sequence.

2. TF-IDF(Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency): To count no. of times each word appear on the document.

TF : (no.of times term t appear in the document) / (no. of terms in the document)
IDF : log(N/n)
        N -> no. of documents
        n -> no. of documents a term t has appeared in.

    The IDF value of a rare word is high, whereas the IDF of a frequent word is low.

TF-IDF : TF * IDF
